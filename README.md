## Problem statement
AtliQ Hardware, with multiple branches across India, provides computer hardware and peripheral manufacturers to its clients. The HR department of a company is facing challenges in monitoring employee attendance and identifying patterns of absenteeism. They need to have a comprehensive view of the attendance records of all employees, including the number of leaves taken and reasons for absence. 

## Solution 
As a data analyst, to solve the problem of analyzing employee attendance and presence for HR, developing BI dashboard can help in identifying trends, patterns, and issues that could impact the company's productivity and profitability. 

## Data
We are provided with the Excel datasheet which contains the employees data for 3 months between April 2022-June 2022. Data set contains employees attendance data along with attendance keys Eg: SL --> Sick Leave.

## Task
* Find **Total Employees Attendance %, Sick Leave % and Work from home %**
* Find the trends for it over time
* Analyzing the same trends in weekdays

## Key Findings: 
Let's delve into these findings to extract meaningful conclusions. 

* Overall Presence: An impressive overall employee presence rate of approximately 91.8% demonstrates a strong commitment to in-office work. This reflects the dedication and professionalism of the workforce at Atliq Technologies.

* Working from Home (WFH): Around 10% of employees prefer the flexibility of working from home. This insight underscores the importance of providing a work-from-home option to promote employee satisfaction and achieve a healthy work-life balance. 

*  Sick Leave (SL) Percentage: The sick leave percentage stands at a commendable 1.1%, indicating a culture of strong attendance and minimal sick leave instances among employees. 

*  Day of the Week and Presence Percentage: Analyzing presence percentages by day of the week reveals interesting patterns: Fridays show a slightly lower presence percentage of 90.1% compared to other weekdays. Mondays witness a high presence percentage of 93.2%, signalling a positive start to the workweek. Thursdays and Wednesdays demonstrate presence percentages of 90.5% and 92.1% respectively, indicating consistent attendance mid-week. Tuesdays mirror Mondays, with a presence percentage of 93.03%. 

## Insights and Recommendations: 
Based on the data analysis, the following insights and recommendations can guide effective decision-making: 

### Office Space Utilization: 
Leverage higher attendance rates on Mondays and Tuesdays to plan team-building exercises and essential meetings that require maximum employee presence. This approach optimizes office space utilization and fosters collaboration. 

### Maintenance and Off-Peak Activities: 
Utilize Fridays and Thursdays, which exhibit slightly lower attendance rates, to focus on office maintenance and organize activities that require fewer employees. This strategy ensures efficient space management without disrupting regular work. 

### Work-from-Home (WFH) Policy: 
Considering the 10% preference for remote work, implementing or strengthening a work-from-home policy can offer employees flexibility and contribute to overall satisfaction and work-life balance. 

### Wellness Programs: 
While the low sick leave percentage indicates good employee health, introducing wellness programs and initiatives can further nurture a healthy work environment, reduce sick leave instances, and promote employee well-being. 

## Conclusion: 
In conclusion, the insightful data analysis empowers Atliq Technologies to optimize office space utilization, foster employee engagement, and enhance work-life balance. By leveraging these findings, the company can make informed decisions regarding team activities, maintenance schedules, work-from-home policies, and wellness programs. These measures will ultimately lead to a more productive and satisfied workforce.
